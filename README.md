# Refined RadImagenet - Conversion Tools

## :zap:	:zap:	Repo moved to [convergedmachine](https://github.com/convergedmachine/Refined-RadImagenet) :zap:	:zap:	

The RadImageNet dataset are available by request at [https://www.radimagenet.com/](https://www.radimagenet.com/))

This code designed to process the RadImagenet and convert to refined and stratified organization.

## Performance Comparison of ResNet Models

This table compares the performance of ResNet models pretrained on 2D RadImagenet using regular and Two2Three convolution techniques across various metrics.

| Features    | Precision (macro) | Recall (macro) | F1 (macro) | Accuracy (balanced) | Accuracy (Average) |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Resnet10t  | 0.4720            | 0.3848         | 0.3998     | 0.3848              | 0.7981             |
| Resnet18   | 0.5150            | 0.4383         | 0.4545     | 0.4383              | 0.8177             |
| Resnet50   | 0.5563            | 0.4934         | 0.5097     | 0.4934              | 0.8352             |

We highly recommend you to adap the code for benchmarking for other models:

### ResNet Models and Weights

The model weights shared through [https://huggingface.co/convergedmachine/RadImagenet](https://huggingface.co/convergedmachine/RadImagenet)

```
timm.create_model('resnet10t', num_classes=165)
```
The trained model are timm implementations.

To create a GitHub README file with the instructions for using Git to clone the Hugging Face repository `convergedmachine/Refined-RadImagenet`, you can format it as follows:

## Download Processing Files

This repository contains files from the Hugging Face repository `convergedmachine/Refined-RadImagenet`. Follow the instructions below to clone the repository using Git.

### Prerequisites

If you haven't installed Git LFS yet, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
git lfs install
```

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the entire repository into your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/convergedmachine/Refined-RadImagenet source/
```

This command will clone all files from the repository into a directory named `source`.

## Notes

- Make sure you have sufficient storage space for large files.
- For more information about this dataset, visit the [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/convergedmachine/Refined-RadImagenet).

Feel free to contribute or raise issues if you encounter any problems.

## Usage

1. **Extract the Dataset**:
```sh
python process.py
```
Ensure the dataset tar file is located at:
```
source/
```
The script will automatically extract to:
```
data/
```

2. **Process the Images**:
   The script will read the CSV files, refined the images, and organize accordingly.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9+
- pandas
- OpenCV
- tarfile
- tqdm
- numpy

Install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas opencv-python tarfile tqdm numpy
```
